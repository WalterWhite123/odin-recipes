# odin-recipes

In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

I will practice all i've learned in the html section of the odin project:
    - Setting the boilerplate
    - putting texts, titles and paragraphs
    - put emphasis on the text with the strong and emphasis html elements
    - putting images and links
    - listing elements
