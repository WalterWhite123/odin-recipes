    <!-- Description of kebab-->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> <strong>Kebab</strong> is a variety of roasted meat dishes that originated in the Middle East. Kebabs consist of
        <em>cut-up meat, sometimes with vegetables and various other accompaniments</em> according to the specific
        recipe. Although kebabs are typically cooked on a skewer over a fire, some kebab dishes are oven-baked in a pan,
        or prepared as a stew such as tas kebab. The traditional meat for kebabs is most often lamb meat, but regional
        recipes may include beef, goat, chicken, fish, or even pork (depending on whether or not there are specific
        religious prohibitions).</p>
    <p>This easy doner-style kebab mimics the kebab meat sliced from a whole with a clever way of baking spiced meat
        folded into parchment. Serve on lavash or pita with fresh tomato and onion, a yogurt sauce, and hot sauce.</p>
