    <!-- Description of kebab-->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> <strong>Kebab</strong> is a variety of roasted meat dishes that originated in the Middle East. Kebabs consist of
        <em>cut-up meat, sometimes with vegetables and various other accompaniments</em> according to the specific
        recipe. Although kebabs are typically cooked on a skewer over a fire, some kebab dishes are oven-baked in a pan,
        or prepared as a stew such as tas kebab. The traditional meat for kebabs is most often lamb meat, but regional
        recipes may include beef, goat, chicken, fish, or even pork (depending on whether or not there are specific
        religious prohibitions).</p>
    <p>This easy doner-style kebab mimics the kebab meat sliced from a whole with a clever way of baking spiced meat
        folded into parchment. Serve on lavash or pita with fresh tomato and onion, a yogurt sauce, and hot sauce.</p>

    <!--Steps-->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

</li>
        <li>Combine ground beef, ground lamb, onion, 3 tablespoons yogurt, olive oil, paprika, cumin, coriander, oregano, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix until very well combined and smooth. 

</li>
        <li>Divide meat mixture among 4 rectangular sheets of parchment paper.  Place a piece of parchment on top of the meat and use a rolling pin to spread it all the way to the edges in a very thin layer covering the sheet of parchment paper. Remove the top sheet. 

</li>
        <li>Starting at the shorter end of the paper, fold the meat covered parchment, several times in about 1 1/2-inch folds. Place folded filled parchment on a rimmed baking sheet. 

</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, draining off some of the accumulated fat and juices halfway through. 

</li>
        <li>Unravel meat from the paper and return to the baking sheet. If you prefer more browning, return unfolded meat to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes longer. Sprinkle with 1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice. 

</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine remaining yogurt and lemon juice in a small bowl. Stir in garlic; season with salt. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons water if sauce seems too thick. 

</li>
        <li>Tear meat into large pieces and serve on warm pita with parsley leaves, sliced onion, and tomato. Drizzle with yogurt sauce and hot sauce.

</li>
    </ol>
