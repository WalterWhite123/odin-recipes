    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like
        other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat (sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals) and water.
        Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina. The pasta is usually white because refined flour
        is used, but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a thicker form of spaghetti, while spaghettini is a
        thinner form. Capellini is a very thin spaghetti, while vermicelli refers to intermediate thicknesses.

        Originally, spaghetti was notably long, but shorter lengths gained in popularity during the second half of the
        20th century and now it is most commonly available in 25–30 cm (10–12 in) lengths. A variety of pasta dishes are
        based on it and it is frequently served with tomato sauce, meat or vegetables.

    </p>
    <p>Caramelized tomato sauce makes this a wonderfully savory dish. The reduction of the tomato broth brings out the
        sweetness of the tomatoes which balances well with the spiciness of the chili flakes.</p>
